# Unit 1: Web Development Fundamentals

## Overview & Importance

Web development fundamentals form the backbone of any AI-integrated application. Before adding intelligence to applications, developers must understand how web applications work — from rendering content in browsers to communicating with servers. This unit ensures you have a solid foundation in core web technologies without dependency on any specific framework.

AI features are ultimately delivered through web interfaces. A strong grasp of fundamentals enables you to:
- Build responsive, accessible interfaces for AI interactions
- Handle asynchronous operations essential for AI API calls
- Structure applications that can scale with AI features
- Debug and optimize AI-powered web applications

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy
- Understanding of how the internet works (HTTP, browsers, servers)
- Text editor or IDE familiarity

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Structure web pages semantically using HTML
- Style and layout interfaces using CSS
- Write JavaScript to handle user interactions and data manipulation
- Make HTTP requests to external services
- Handle asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await
- Work with JSON data structures
- Manage application state effectively
- Understand the DOM and how to manipulate it programmatically

## Real-world Applications

- Building user interfaces for chatbots and AI assistants
- Creating forms that collect data for AI processing
- Displaying AI-generated content dynamically
- Building dashboards that visualize AI outputs
- Handling file uploads for AI analysis (images, documents)

## Market Demand & Relevance

Web development skills remain the most in-demand technical skills globally. According to industry surveys:
- JavaScript is used by 62%+ of developers worldwide
- Every AI product requires a web interface for user interaction
- Companies seek developers who understand both web fundamentals and AI integration
- Salary premium of 15-25% for developers with AI integration skills
- Remote work opportunities are highest in web development roles
