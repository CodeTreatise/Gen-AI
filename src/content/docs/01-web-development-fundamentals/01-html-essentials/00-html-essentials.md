# HTML Essentials

## Introduction

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every web page. Before we can build AI-powered interfaces, chatbots, or intelligent dashboards, we need to understand how to structure content for the browser. HTML provides the semantic skeleton that makes web content accessible, searchable, and machine-readable.

In this lesson series, we'll build a solid HTML foundation that prepares you for creating AI-integrated web applications.
