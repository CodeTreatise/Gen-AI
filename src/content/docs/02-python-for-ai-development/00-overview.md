# Unit 2: Python for AI Development

## Overview & Importance

Python is the dominant programming language for artificial intelligence and machine learning. While JavaScript powers web frontends, Python is the lingua franca of AI development — virtually every AI library, framework, and tool is written in or has primary support for Python. This unit provides the comprehensive Python foundation essential for serious AI/ML work, covering everything from fundamentals to async programming, data visualization, and production-ready code quality practices.

Understanding Python for AI matters because:
- 95% of AI/ML job postings require Python proficiency
- All major AI frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain) are Python-first
- Data manipulation and analysis libraries are Python-native
- AI APIs have the best SDK support in Python
- Research and prototyping happen predominantly in Python
- Production ML pipelines are typically Python-based

This unit bridges web development skills with AI development requirements, ensuring you can work across the full stack of modern AI applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)
- Understanding of web development fundamentals (Unit 1)
- Familiarity with command line/terminal
- Text editor or IDE setup

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Write clean, idiomatic Python code following best practices
- Work with Python data structures effectively
- Use NumPy for numerical computing operations
- Manipulate and analyze data with Pandas
- Make HTTP requests and consume APIs in Python
- Manage virtual environments and dependencies
- Apply type hints and modern Python features
- Debug and test Python code effectively
- Set up Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
- Master async programming patterns for AI applications
- Create effective data visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn
- Implement concurrency for parallel processing
- Use modern code quality tools (ruff, black, pre-commit)
- Understand scikit-learn basics for ML workflows
