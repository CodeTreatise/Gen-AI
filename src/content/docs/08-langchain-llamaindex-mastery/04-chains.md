# 8.4 Chains

## Chain Fundamentals
- What are chains
- LCEL chain syntax
- invoke, batch, stream
- Chain composition
- Chain inputs and outputs

## Sequential Chains
- Chaining operations
- Passing data through chains
- Intermediate transformations
- Chain debugging
- Error propagation

## Parallel Chains
- RunnableParallel
- Concurrent execution
- Combining parallel results
- Performance benefits
- Error handling in parallel

## Conditional Chains
- RunnableBranch
- Routing logic
- Dynamic chain selection
- Fallback chains
- Complex branching

## Transform Chains
- Data transformation
- Input/output transformation
- RunnableLambda usage
- Custom transformation logic
- Streaming transformations

## Advanced Chain Patterns
- Chain of chains
- Recursive chains
- Self-routing chains
- Human-in-the-loop patterns
- Chain checkpointing
