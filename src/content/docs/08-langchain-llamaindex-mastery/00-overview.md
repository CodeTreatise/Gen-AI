# Unit 8: LangChain & LlamaIndex Mastery

## Overview & Importance

LangChain and LlamaIndex are the two most widely adopted frameworks for building LLM-powered applications. Understanding these frameworks is essential for modern AI development — they are mentioned in the majority of GenAI job postings and represent industry-standard approaches to building production AI applications.

**2025 Update**: Both frameworks have evolved significantly:
- **LangChain** agents are now built on **LangGraph** for stateful, durable execution
- **LlamaIndex** has shifted from DAGs to event-driven **Workflows**
- Production tooling (**LangSmith**, **LlamaCloud**) is now essential knowledge

Mastering these frameworks matters because:
- LangChain + LangGraph is the #1 requested framework stack in GenAI job postings
- LlamaIndex Workflows expertise is highly valued for production RAG roles
- Both provide production-ready patterns for complex AI agents
- They significantly accelerate AI application development
- Understanding them enables building sophisticated RAG and agentic systems
- LangGraph and Workflows enable human-in-the-loop and durable execution
- Industry has standardized on these for LLM orchestration

## Prerequisites

- Strong Python fundamentals (Unit 2)
- Understanding of AI/LLM fundamentals (Unit 3)
- API integration experience (Unit 4)
- Prompt engineering basics (Unit 6)
- Embeddings and vector concepts (Unit 7)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Build applications using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
- Create sophisticated prompt templates with variables and few-shot examples
- Implement structured output parsing with Pydantic
- Build complex chains with branching and parallel execution
- Implement conversation memory systems
- Load and process documents from various sources
- Build retrieval systems with multiple strategies
- Use LlamaIndex for document-based AI applications
- Create query engines and chat engines
- **Build stateful agents with LangGraph** (StateGraph, nodes, edges)
- **Implement human-in-the-loop patterns with interrupts**
- **Create event-driven workflows with LlamaIndex Workflows**
- **Deploy and monitor production agents with LangSmith and LlamaCloud**
- Choose the right framework for specific use cases
- Combine both frameworks when appropriate
