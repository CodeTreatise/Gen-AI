# 8.12 Framework Integration

## Choosing the Right Framework
- LangChain strengths
- LlamaIndex strengths
- When to use each
- Combining frameworks
- Migration considerations

## LangChain with LlamaIndex
- Using LlamaIndex retrievers in LangChain
- LlamaIndex as tool for LangChain agents
- Shared vector stores
- Embedding compatibility
- Code patterns

## LangGraph Integration
- LlamaIndex in LangGraph nodes
- State management
- Complex workflows
- Agent orchestration
- Production patterns

## Common Architectures
- RAG with both frameworks
- Multi-agent with mixed frameworks
- Routing between frameworks
- Fallback patterns
- Best practices

## Production Considerations
- Dependency management
- Version compatibility
- Performance comparison
- Cost optimization
- Monitoring both

## Future Developments
- Framework convergence
- Emerging patterns
- Community direction
- Keeping current
- Contribution opportunities
