# Unit 3: AI & LLM Fundamentals

## Overview & Importance

Understanding AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) conceptually is essential before integrating them into applications. This unit demystifies AI terminology, explains how LLMs work at a high level, and covers the key concepts every developer needs to know — without requiring a machine learning background.

As a web developer integrating AI, you don't need to train models, but you must understand:
- What LLMs can and cannot do
- How to communicate effectively with AI systems
- The constraints and costs involved
- How to choose the right model for your use case

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Understanding of APIs conceptually
- Familiarity with data structures (arrays, objects)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Explain what Large Language Models are and how they work conceptually
- Understand tokenization and its impact on cost and context
- Differentiate between various AI model types and their use cases
- Evaluate model capabilities for specific applications
- Understand the trade-offs between different models
- Explain concepts like context windows, temperature, and sampling
- Make informed decisions about model selection
- Identify AI safety risks and apply mitigation strategies
- Use structured outputs and JSON mode effectively
- Interpret model benchmarks for informed selection

## Real-world Applications

- Selecting appropriate models for chatbot applications
- Estimating costs for AI-powered features
- Designing applications around context window limits
- Making architecture decisions based on model capabilities
- Building fallback systems with multiple model providers
- Implementing AI safety measures in production applications
- Designing structured output schemas for reliable parsing
- Evaluating models using benchmarks for specific use cases
- Building agentic applications with tool-use models
- Implementing document processing pipelines with vision models

## Market Demand & Relevance

- 76% of developers now use or plan to use AI tools in development
- Understanding LLM fundamentals is becoming a baseline requirement
- Companies are rapidly adopting AI across all industries
- AI literacy differentiates candidates in hiring processes
- New roles emerging: AI Engineer, Prompt Engineer, ML Ops Engineer
- Average salary increase of 20-30% for AI-skilled developers
