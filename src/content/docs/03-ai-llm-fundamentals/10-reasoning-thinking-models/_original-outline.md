# Reasoning & Thinking Models

- What are reasoning models? (o1, o3, Claude thinking)
  - Models that "think" before answering
  - Internal chain-of-thought
  - OpenAI o1 and o3 series
  - Claude extended thinking mode
  - Gemini thinking capabilities
- Extended thinking vs. fast responses
  - When to use each mode
  - Latency implications
  - Quality improvements from thinking
  - User experience considerations
- When to use reasoning models
  - Complex multi-step problems
  - Mathematical reasoning
  - Code debugging and analysis
  - Strategic planning tasks
  - Scientific reasoning
- Cost implications of thinking tokens
  - Thinking tokens add to cost
  - Budgeting for reasoning
  - Cost vs quality trade-off
  - Optimizing thinking budget
- Reasoning budget and test-time compute
  - Configurable compute allocation (o3 low/medium/high)
  - Test-time compute scaling — More thinking = better results
  - Reasoning token limits
  - Dynamic budget based on task complexity
- Reasoning token visibility
  - OpenAI: Hidden reasoning, summary only
  - Claude: Optional thinking block visibility
  - Gemini: Thinking process access
  - Debugging with visible reasoning
- Streaming thinking blocks
  - Showing thinking process to users
  - Hiding vs revealing reasoning
  - UX patterns for thinking display
  - Progressive disclosure of thought
- Verifiable reasoning outputs
  - Inspecting reasoning steps
  - Debugging through thinking
  - Consistency checking
  - Reasoning audits
