# Unit 12: Multi-Agent Systems

## Overview & Importance

Multi-Agent Systems represent the cutting edge of AI development — "Agentic AI" is the fastest-growing category in the AI industry. This unit provides comprehensive coverage of modern multi-agent frameworks including LangGraph, AutoGen 0.4+, CrewAI Flows, OpenAI Agents SDK, and Magentic-One — the leading technologies for building sophisticated AI systems where multiple agents collaborate, delegate, and coordinate to solve complex problems.

Multi-agent systems matter because:
- "Agentic AI" is the most discussed trend in AI development
- Complex tasks require specialized agents working together
- Multi-agent architectures enable scalable AI solutions
- Enterprise AI systems increasingly use agent orchestration
- Research shows multi-agent outperforms single-agent approaches
- Enables division of labor and specialized expertise
- AutoGen 0.4+ represents a major paradigm shift (async-first)
- OpenAI Agents SDK is the production standard for OpenAI users
- Magentic-One achieves SOTA on major benchmarks

## Prerequisites

- AI Agents fundamentals (Unit 9)
- LangChain & LlamaIndex proficiency (Unit 8)
- Function calling and tool use (Unit 7)
- Strong Python skills (Unit 2)
- API integration experience (Unit 3)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Design multi-agent architectures for complex tasks
- Build graph-based agents with LangGraph
- Implement async multi-agent systems with AutoGen 0.4+
- Create role-based crews with CrewAI and Flows
- Deploy Magentic-One patterns for web/file automation
- Build production agents with OpenAI Agents SDK
- Implement agent communication patterns
- Handle agent coordination and state management
- Build human-in-the-loop workflows
- Debug and monitor multi-agent systems
- Deploy multi-agent systems to production
- Choose the right framework for specific use cases
- Design hybrid multi-framework architectures
