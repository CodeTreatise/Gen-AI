# 12.1 Multi-Agent Concepts

## Why Multiple Agents
- Limitations of single agents
- Specialization benefits
- Divide and conquer approach
- Parallel processing
- Fault tolerance

## Multi-Agent Architectures
- Peer-to-peer systems
- Hierarchical systems
- Supervisor-worker pattern
- Pipeline architectures
- Mesh architectures

## Agent Roles
- Coordinator agents
- Worker agents
- Specialist agents
- Validator agents
- Human proxy agents

## Communication Patterns
- Direct messaging
- Broadcast messaging
- Publish-subscribe
- Request-response
- Event-driven

## State Management
- Shared state
- Agent-local state
- State synchronization
- Conflict resolution
- State persistence

## Design Considerations
- Agent granularity
- Coupling vs cohesion
- Scalability patterns
- Error propagation
- Debugging complexity
