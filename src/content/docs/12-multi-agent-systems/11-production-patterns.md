# 12.11 Production Multi-Agent Systems

## Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling
- Agent pool management
- Load distribution
- Resource allocation
- Queue management

## Performance Optimization
- Parallel execution
- Caching strategies
- Agent warm-up
- Connection pooling
- Batch processing

## Monitoring and Observability
- LangSmith for LangGraph
- Custom metrics

- Conversation logging
- Cost monitoring

## Cost Management
- Token usage tracking
- Agent call optimization
- Caching for cost reduction
- Model selection per agent
- Budget limits

## Security Considerations
- Agent isolation
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- Access control
- Audit logging

## Error Handling & Recovery
- Agent failures
- Communication failures
- Retry mechanisms
- Fallback strategies
- State recovery

## Deployment Patterns
