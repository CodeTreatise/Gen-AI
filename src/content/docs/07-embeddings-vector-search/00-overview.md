# Unit 7: Embeddings & Vector Search

## Overview & Importance

Embeddings transform text into numerical representations that capture meaning. Vector search enables finding semantically similar content — not just keyword matches. These technologies power modern search, recommendations, and form the foundation for RAG systems.

Understanding embeddings is essential for:
- Building search that understands meaning, not just keywords
- Connecting AI to your own data
- Creating recommendation systems
- Enabling semantic clustering and analysis

## Prerequisites

- JavaScript proficiency (Unit 1)
- API integration skills (Unit 3)
- Basic understanding of AI concepts (Unit 2)
- Familiarity with databases

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Explain what embeddings are and how they represent meaning
- Generate embeddings using AI APIs
- Store embeddings efficiently in vector databases
- Perform similarity searches on embedded content
- Choose appropriate embedding models for use cases
- Design chunking strategies for documents
- Implement semantic search in applications

## Real-world Applications

- Semantic search engines (enterprise, e-commerce)
- Document similarity and duplicate detection
- Plagiarism and content originality detection
- Content recommendation systems
- FAQ matching and customer self-service
- Customer support ticket routing and classification
- Similar product recommendations
- Research paper and patent discovery
- Code search and similar code detection
- Legal document analysis and case matching
- Medical record similarity for clinical trials
- Fraud detection (anomalous transaction patterns)
- Content moderation (semantic policy matching)
- Personalized content feeds
- Knowledge base Q&A systems
- Multimodal search (image + text)

## Market Demand & Relevance (2025-2026)
