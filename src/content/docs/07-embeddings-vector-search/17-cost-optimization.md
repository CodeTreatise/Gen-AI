# Cost Optimization

- Embedding cost factors
  - API calls: per-token pricing
  - Storage: vector database costs
  - Compute: query processing
  - Bandwidth: data transfer
- Batch embedding discounts
  - Gemini: 50% off for batch API
  - OpenAI: batch API discounts
  - Batch size optimization
  - Async batch processing patterns
- Caching ROI
  - Calculate cache hit rates
  - Storage cost vs API cost
  - Embedding deduplication
  - Warm cache strategies
- Dimension reduction savings
  - 50% dimensions = 50% storage
  - Faster search = lower compute
  - Quality vs cost trade-off
  - Benchmark before reducing
- Self-hosting economics
  - GPU costs for embedding
  - Open source model quality
  - Break-even analysis
  - Hybrid approaches
- Right-sizing vector database
  - Serverless for variable load
  - Reserved capacity for predictable
  - Multi-tier storage strategies
  - Archive old embeddings
