# Managed RAG Services (2025)

- The managed RAG paradigm
  - End-to-end RAG without infrastructure
  - Auto-chunking, auto-embedding, auto-indexing
  - API-level simplicity
  - Trade: control vs convenience
- OpenAI Vector Stores & File Search
  - Create vector store via API
  - Upload files (PDF, docs, code, etc.)
  - Automatic processing pipeline
  - Use with Responses API file_search tool
  - Citations in responses
  - Metadata filtering support
  - max_num_results for cost control
- Gemini File Search (2025)
  - FileSearchStore creation
  - uploadToFileSearchStore API
  - Chunking configuration:
    - max_tokens_per_chunk
    - max_overlap_tokens
  - File metadata for filtering
  - Citations in grounding_metadata
  - Works with Gemini 3 models
  - Pricing: embeddings at indexing, storage free
- Comparison: OpenAI vs Gemini managed RAG
  - OpenAI: broader file format support
  - Gemini: chunking configuration control
  - Both: automatic citation support
  - Both: metadata filtering
  - Consider: existing API ecosystem
- When to use managed RAG
  - Rapid prototyping
  - Simple knowledge bases (<1GB)
  - Teams without vector DB expertise
  - Cost-sensitivity (no infrastructure)
- When to build custom
  - Complex chunking requirements
  - Hybrid search needs
  - Multi-tenant architectures
  - Fine-tuned embedding models
  - Regulatory requirements
- Limitations of managed services
  - Less control over chunking
  - Fixed embedding models
  - Rate limits and quotas
  - Vendor lock-in considerations
  - May not support latest techniques
