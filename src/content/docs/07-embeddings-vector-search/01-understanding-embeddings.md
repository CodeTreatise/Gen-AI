# Understanding Embeddings

- What are embeddings?
  - Numerical representations of content
  - Dense vectors capturing meaning
  - Machine-readable semantics
  - Foundation for AI search
- Vector representations of meaning
  - How meaning is encoded
  - Similar concepts, similar vectors
  - Relationship preservation
  - Semantic arithmetic (king - man + woman = queen)
- Dimensionality (768, 1536, 3072 dimensions)
  - What dimensions represent
  - Higher dimensions = more nuance
  - Common dimension sizes
  - Storage and compute trade-offs
- Semantic similarity concept
  - Beyond keyword matching
  - Understanding synonyms and concepts
  - Context-aware similarity
  - Limitations of similarity
- Distance metrics (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, dot product)
  - Cosine similarity explained
  - When to use each metric
  - Normalized vs. unnormalized vectors
  - Metric impact on results
- Visualizing embeddings (dimensionality reduction)
  - t-SNE visualization
  - UMAP for dimensionality reduction
  - PCA basics
  - Interpretation of visualizations
