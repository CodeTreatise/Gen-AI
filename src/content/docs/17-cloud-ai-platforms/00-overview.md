# Unit 17: Cloud AI Platforms

## Overview & Importance

Cloud AI platforms provide enterprise-grade infrastructure for deploying, scaling, and managing AI applications. AWS Bedrock (with AgentCore), Microsoft Foundry (formerly Azure AI Foundry), and Google Cloud Vertex AI (with Gemini 3) are the three major platforms that dominate enterprise AI deployments in 2025-2026.

Cloud AI platforms matter because:
- Enterprises deploy AI through cloud providers
- Managed services reduce operational complexity
- Cloud platforms offer enterprise security and compliance
- Scaling and reliability are built-in
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerging as standard for AI integration
- AgentCore, Foundry Agent Service, and Agent Builder enable production agents
- Certifications in cloud AI are highly valued (15-25% salary premium)

## Prerequisites

- Python proficiency (Unit 2)
- API Integration fundamentals (Unit 3)
- LangChain/LlamaIndex basics (Unit 8)
- Production & Optimization concepts (Unit 16)
- Basic cloud computing concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Deploy AI applications on AWS Bedrock with AgentCore
- Use Microsoft Foundry for enterprise AI
- Build with Google Cloud Vertex AI and Gemini 3
- Implement cloud-based RAG systems
- Configure security and compliance features
- Integrate cloud AI with existing infrastructure using MCP
- Implement multi-cloud AI strategies
- Deploy serverless AI patterns at scale
