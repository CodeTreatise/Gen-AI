# Unit 20: AI UX & Conversational Design

## Overview & Importance

AI user experience differs fundamentally from traditional software UX. Users interact through natural language, expect intelligent responses, and may not understand AI limitations. This unit covers design principles, patterns, and practices for creating effective, user-friendly AI experiences.

Good AI UX matters because:
- Poor UX leads to user frustration and abandonment
- AI capabilities must be communicated clearly
- User trust requires transparency and reliability
- Conversational design requires different thinking than traditional UI

## Prerequisites

- UI development skills (Unit 1)
- Chat interface building (Unit 4)
- Understanding of AI capabilities and limitations (Unit 2)
- Basic UX design awareness

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Design intuitive AI-powered user experiences
- Create effective conversation flows
- Manage user expectations appropriately
- Design for AI errors and limitations
- Build trust through transparent AI design
- Measure and improve AI UX metrics
- Apply accessibility principles to AI interfaces
- Design Canvas/Artifacts collaborative workspaces (NEW 2024-2025)
- Create extended thinking UX with visible reasoning (NEW 2025)
- Build agentic AI interfaces with multi-step task visualization (NEW 2025-2026)
- Apply AI literacy principles to educate users (NEW 2025-2026)
- Implement voice conversation design patterns
- Use Apple HIG ML patterns (calibration, confidence, attribution)

## Real-world Applications

- Consumer AI product design
- Enterprise AI tool UX
- Customer support chatbot design
- AI writing assistant interfaces
- Voice assistant design
- AI-powered mobile apps

## Market Demand & Relevance

- AI UX design is emerging specialty
- High-impact role in AI product success
- Combines technical and design skills
- Growing demand as AI products mature
- Competitive advantage for products
- User retention depends on good AI UX
