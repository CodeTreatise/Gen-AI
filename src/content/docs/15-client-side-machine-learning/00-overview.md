# Unit 15: Client-Side Machine Learning

## Overview & Importance

Client-side ML runs machine learning models directly in the browser, without server round-trips. This enables real-time inference, offline capabilities, and privacy-preserving AI features. This unit covers running pre-trained models in JavaScript.

Client-side ML enables:
- Real-time AI without latency
- Offline-capable AI features
- Privacy-first AI (data never leaves device)
- Reduced server costs for inference

## Prerequisites

- Strong JavaScript skills (Unit 1)
- Understanding of AI model concepts (Unit 2)
- Basic understanding of tensors and arrays
- Browser performance awareness

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Run pre-trained ML models in the browser
- Use TensorFlow.js for inference tasks
- Implement common ML features (image classification, pose detection)
- Handle model loading and optimization
- Manage memory and performance
- Use WebGPU for accelerated inference
- Choose between client-side and server-side AI
