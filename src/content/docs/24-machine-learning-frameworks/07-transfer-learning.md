# 24.7 Transfer Learning

## Transfer Learning Concepts
- Pre-trained models
- Feature extraction
- Fine-tuning
- Domain adaptation
- When to use

## Using Pre-trained Models
- Model zoos
- torchvision models
- Keras applications
- Loading weights
- Model inspection

## Feature Extraction
- Freezing layers
- Using as feature extractor
- Replacing head
- Embedding extraction
- Similarity search

## Fine-tuning Strategies
- Full fine-tuning
- Last layer only
- Progressive unfreezing
- Layer-wise learning rates
- Discriminative fine-tuning

## Domain-Specific Tuning
- Small dataset strategies
- Augmentation importance
- Learning rate selection
- Regularization
- Evaluation

## Common Applications
- Image classification transfer
- NLP transfer learning
- Computer vision
- Multi-modal transfer
- Cross-lingual transfer
