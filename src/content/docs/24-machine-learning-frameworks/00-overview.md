# Unit 24: Machine Learning Frameworks

## Overview & Importance

Machine learning frameworks provide the foundation for training, fine-tuning, and deploying AI models in the modern AI era. While many developers work primarily with pre-trained models via APIs, understanding PyTorch 2.x, TensorFlow, the Hugging Face ecosystem, and modern inference engines enables deeper customization, fine-tuning, and production optimization — skills that differentiate senior AI engineers.

ML frameworks matter because:
- Required for fine-tuning and custom models
- PyTorch 2.x is the dominant framework for AI research and production
- Hugging Face is essential for working with transformer models
- Understanding enables optimization of AI applications
- Foundation for advanced AI development (RLHF, DPO, GRPO)
- Necessary for on-device and edge AI (ExecuTorch)
- Modern inference (vLLM, SGLang) requires framework knowledge
- Career advancement in AI requires moving beyond API-only work
