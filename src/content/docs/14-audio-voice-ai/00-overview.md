# Unit 14: Audio & Voice AI

## Overview & Importance

Audio AI enables voice interactions with applications — converting speech to text, generating human-like speech, and processing audio content. This unit covers speech recognition, text-to-speech, and audio handling in web applications.

### 2025-2026 Evolution

The audio/voice AI landscape has transformed dramatically:

| Capability | 2023 | 2025-2026 |
|------------|------|------------|
| Transcription | Whisper API | GPT-4o-transcribe, Nova-3, Universal-2 |
| Text-to-Speech | Basic TTS | Promptable TTS, custom voice cloning |
| Voice Agents | Text-based chatbots | Native speech-to-speech (Realtime API) |
| Emotion | Not available | Empathic AI (Hume EVI), expression measurement |
| Latency | 500ms+ | Sub-100ms real-time |

Voice AI enables:
- Hands-free application interaction
- Accessibility for vision-impaired users
- Transcription and note-taking automation
- Natural voice interfaces for AI assistants
- Real-time voice agents with function calling (NEW 2025)
- Empathic conversational AI with emotion detection (NEW 2025)
- Custom voice cloning with consent workflows (NEW 2025)

## Prerequisites

- API integration skills (Unit 3)
- JavaScript fundamentals (Unit 1)
- HTML5 audio APIs awareness
- File handling basics
