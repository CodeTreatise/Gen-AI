# Few-Shot Prompting

- What is few-shot learning?
  - Learning from examples in prompt
  - Pattern recognition from samples
  - No training required
  - In-context learning mechanism
- Example selection strategies
  - Diverse examples
  - Representative cases
  - Edge case coverage
  - Similar to target input
- Example formatting
  - Input/output pairs
  - Clear delimiters
  - Consistent structure
  - Labels (e.g., "Input:" "Output:")
- Number of examples optimization
  - Diminishing returns analysis
  - Token cost consideration
  - Quality vs. quantity
  - Typical recommendations (3-5)
- Zero-shot vs. few-shot trade-offs
  - When zero-shot is sufficient
  - Complex task few-shot
  - Cost considerations
  - Latency impact
- Dynamic example selection
  - Runtime example selection
  - Similarity-based retrieval
  - Task-specific examples
  - A/B testing examples
- **RAG-Enhanced Few-Shot**
  - Retrieve examples from vector database
  - Semantic similarity to current query
  - Dynamic example count based on context
  - Combining retrieved examples with curated ones
  - Example quality scoring
