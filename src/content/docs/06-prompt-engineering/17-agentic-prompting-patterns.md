# Agentic Prompting Patterns

- **What is Agentic Prompting?**
  - Prompts for autonomous task completion
  - Multi-turn, tool-using agents
  - Planning and execution loops
  - Error recovery and adaptation
- **Tool Definition Prompts**
  - Clear tool descriptions
  - Parameter specifications
  - Expected return values
  - Error conditions
  - When to use which tool
- **Multi-Turn Agent Loops**
  - Maintaining context across turns
  - Tool result handling
  - Reasoning context preservation
  - `previous_response_id` for continuity
- **Goal-Oriented Prompts**
  - Define end goal clearly
  - Success criteria
  - Allow flexible approach
  - Trust model to plan steps
- **MCP Server Prompting**
  - Model Context Protocol tool discovery
  - Dynamic tool availability
  - Tool composition patterns
  - Context injection from MCP
- **Agentic Safety Patterns**
  - Confirmation prompts for risky actions
  - Scope limitation instructions
  - Rollback and undo guidance
  - Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- **Agent Builder & AgentKit**
  - OpenAI Agent Builder visual canvas
  - Workflow composition
  - Logic nodes for control flow
  - Prompt integration with tools
- **Computer Use Prompting**
  - Screen observation and action generation
  - Click, type, scroll action formats
  - Coordinate-based vs element-based targeting
  - Safety constraints for computer control
  - Verification prompts between actions
  - Error recovery for failed actions
  - OpenAI Operator / Anthropic computer_use patterns
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
  - Prompts for agent handoffs
  - Specialist agent routing
  - Shared context management
  - Conflict resolution between agents
