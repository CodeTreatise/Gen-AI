# Multimodal Prompting

- **Image Prompting Fundamentals**
  - Images as input to vision-capable models
  - Text + image combined prompts
  - URL reference vs base64 inline
  - File API upload for large/repeated images
- **Image Input Best Practices**
  - Clear, non-blurry images
  - Correct orientation (rotate if needed)
  - Place text prompt after image in content array
  - Use detail parameter: `low`, `high`, `auto`
  - Token cost increases with resolution
- **Multi-Image Prompts**
  - Compare multiple images in one prompt
  - Reference images for style guidance
  - Before/after analysis
  - Mix inline and uploaded images
- **Document Understanding**
  - PDF and document inputs
  - Table extraction prompts
  - Chart and graph analysis
  - Form field extraction
  - OCR from imperfect images
- **Vision-Specific Capabilities**
  - Object detection with bounding boxes
  - Image segmentation (Gemini 2.5+)
  - Visual question answering
  - Image captioning
  - Spatial reasoning (with limitations)
- **Gemini Vision Features**
  - `media_resolution` parameter for token control
  - Object detection: `box_2d` normalized 0-1000
  - Segmentation masks with labels
  - Disable thinking for object detection: `thinking_budget: 0`
- **Vision Limitations to Note**
  - Not for medical image interpretation
  - May struggle with non-Latin text
  - Approximate counts for objects
  - Spatial reasoning challenges
  - No CAPTCHA processing (safety)
- **Audio Input Prompting**
  - Speech-to-text preprocessing vs direct input
  - Transcription quality considerations
  - Multi-language audio handling
  - Audio context in prompts
- **Video Understanding (Gemini)**
  - Video files as input (Gemini 2.0+)
  - Upload via Files API for large videos
  - Frame-by-frame vs holistic analysis
  - Temporal reasoning prompts ("what happens at 2:30?")
  - Video summarization prompts
  - Action recognition and scene detection
  - Combining video with text instructions
  - Token cost proportional to video length
