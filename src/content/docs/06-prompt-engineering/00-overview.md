# Unit 6: Prompt Engineering

## Overview & Importance

Prompt engineering is the art and science of communicating effectively with AI models. The quality of AI outputs directly depends on how well prompts are crafted. This unit teaches systematic approaches to writing prompts that produce consistent, high-quality results.

Prompt engineering is crucial because:
- The same model can produce vastly different outputs based on prompts
- Well-designed prompts reduce errors and hallucinations
- Effective prompts can replace complex code logic
- It's often the highest-impact optimization available

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of LLM fundamentals (Unit 2)
- Basic API integration experience (Unit 3)
- Logical thinking and clear communication skills

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Write clear, effective prompts for various tasks
- Design system prompts and use developer role effectively
- Use few-shot examples to guide model outputs
- Structure prompts for consistent output formats
- Implement chain-of-thought reasoning (when appropriate)
- **Prompt reasoning models (o3, GPT-5) differently from standard models**
- **Create multimodal prompts with images, documents, and video**
- **Design prompts for agentic workflows and tool use**
- **Configure extended thinking for complex tasks**
- **Use evaluation systems to optimize prompts**
- **Defend against prompt injection attacks**
- **Build multi-stage prompt pipelines**
- **Manage context windows and token budgets**
- Avoid common prompting pitfalls
- Test and iterate on prompts systematically

## Real-world Applications

- Creating consistent customer service responses
- Generating structured data from unstructured input
- Building reliable content generation systems
- Code generation with specific requirements
- Data extraction and transformation
- Multi-language content generation
- **Document processing with vision models (receipts, forms, charts)**
- **Autonomous agents for complex multi-step tasks**
- **Reasoning-intensive analysis (legal, financial, scientific)**
- **Prompt optimization at scale with automated evals**
- **Image analysis pipelines (object detection, content moderation)**

## Market Demand & Relevance

- "Prompt Engineer" is now a recognized job title
- Salary range: $80,000 - $200,000+ for specialized roles
- Every AI integration requires prompt engineering
- Skills transferable across all LLM providers
- Low barrier to entry, high ceiling for mastery
- Critical for AI product quality and reliability
