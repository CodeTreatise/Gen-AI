  - Constraint prioritization
  - Handling constraint conflicts
- Meta-prompting (prompts about prompts)
  - Generating prompts with AI

  - Self-improvement cycles
  - Prompt debugging assistance
- Decomposition strategies
  - Task breakdown approaches

  - Path evaluation
  - Backtracking
  - Best path selection
- Self-consistency checking
  - Multiple generations
  - Voting on answers
  - Confidence estimation
  - Inconsistency detection
- **Self-Critique Prompts**
  - Ask model to review its own output
  - "Before returning, verify against constraints"
  - Check intent vs literal interpretation
  - Verify tone matches persona
  - Reflexion pattern for iterative improvement
- **Explicit Planning Prompts**
  - "Before answering, create a step-by-step plan"
  - Parse goal into sub-tasks
