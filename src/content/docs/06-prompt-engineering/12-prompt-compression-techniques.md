# Prompt Compression Techniques

- Reducing token count without losing meaning
  - Synonym selection for brevity
  - Removing filler words
  - Terse instruction style
  - Abbreviation strategies
- Abbreviation strategies
  - Common abbreviation patterns
  - Domain-specific abbreviations
  - Ensuring model understanding
  - Testing abbreviated prompts
- Removing redundancy
  - Identifying repeated information
  - Consolidating similar instructions
  - Implicit vs explicit trade-offs
  - Example optimization
- Efficient example formatting
  - Minimal example structure
  - Representative examples
  - Combined examples
  - Dynamic example count
- Cost-aware prompt design
  - Token budget allocation
  - High-impact content prioritization
  - Cost monitoring integration
  - ROI-based optimization
- Compression vs. quality trade-offs
  - Quality degradation thresholds
  - Testing compression impact
  - Finding the optimal balance
  - Task-specific recommendations
- **Predicted Outputs for Speed**
  - OpenAI `prediction` parameter
  - Provide expected output for faster generation
  - Speculative decoding optimization
  - Best for code edits, template filling
  - Reduces latency significantly
  - Example: `prediction: { type: "content", content: expectedOutput }`
