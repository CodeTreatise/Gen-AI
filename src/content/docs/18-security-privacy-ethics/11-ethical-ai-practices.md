# Ethical AI Practices

- Responsible AI Principles
  - Fairness (equitable treatment)
  - Reliability & safety (predictable behavior)
  - Privacy & security (data protection)
  - Inclusiveness (accessible to all)
  - Transparency (explainable decisions)
  - Accountability (human oversight)
- Responsible AI Frameworks (NEW 2025)
  - Microsoft Responsible AI Standard v2
  - Google AI Principles
  - OpenAI Safety Framework
  - Anthropic Constitutional AI
  - IBM AI Ethics Board
  - Partnership on AI guidelines
- OpenAI Preparedness Framework v2 (NEW 2025)
  - Tracked Categories:
    - Biological and Chemical capabilities
    - Cybersecurity capabilities
    - AI Self-improvement capabilities
  - Research Categories:
    - Long-range Autonomy
    - Sandbagging (intentional underperforming)
    - Autonomous Replication and Adaptation
    - Undermining Safeguards
    - Nuclear and Radiological
  - Capability Levels:
    - High: amplifies existing harm pathways
    - Critical: introduces new harm pathways
  - Safety Advisory Group (SAG) review
  - Capabilities Reports + Safeguards Reports
  - System cards for each model release
- Anthropic Responsible Scaling Policy (NEW 2025)
  - AI Safety Levels (ASL-1 to ASL-4)
  - ASL-2: current production models
  - ASL-3: models with significant uplift
  - Capability evaluations before deployment
  - Commitment to pause at ASL thresholds
- Human Oversight Requirements
  - Human-in-the-loop (approval before action)
  - Human-on-the-loop (monitoring with intervention)
  - Human-over-the-loop (policy and governance)
  - Escalation procedures (complex cases)
  - Accountability structures (clear ownership)
  - EU AI Act human oversight requirements
- Harm Prevention Strategies
  - Risk assessment (pre-deployment)
  - Harm categories (physical, psychological, societal)
  - Prevention measures (guardrails)
  - Incident response (rapid containment)
  - Dual-use risk assessment
- Inclusive Design for AI
  - Accessibility features (screen readers, captions)
  - Diverse user needs (age, ability, language)
  - Cultural sensitivity (regional adaptation)
  - Language inclusivity (multilingual support)
  - Disability accommodation
- Environmental Considerations (NEW 2025)
  - AI energy consumption awareness
  - Carbon footprint of training
  - Sustainable inference practices
  - Efficiency optimization (smaller models)
  - Green AI initiatives
  - Model distillation for efficiency
- Industry Guidelines and Standards
  - IEEE 7000 series (ethical AI)
  - ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management)
  - Partnership on AI
  - OECD AI Principles
