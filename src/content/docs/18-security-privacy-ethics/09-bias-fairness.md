# Bias & Fairness

- Types of AI Bias
  - Training data bias (historical patterns)
  - Selection bias (non-representative samples)
  - Confirmation bias (reinforcing assumptions)
  - Representation bias (group imbalances)
  - Measurement bias (flawed metrics)
  - Algorithmic bias (model amplification)
- Bias in Training Data Effects
  - Amplification effects
  - Stereotype reinforcement
  - Underrepresentation of minorities
  - Historical discrimination encoded
  - Intersectional bias (compound effects)
- AI Fairness Testing Frameworks (NEW 2025)
  - Microsoft Fairlearn
  - Google What-If Tool
  - IBM AI Fairness 360
  - Aequitas (bias audit toolkit)
  - Fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds)
- Testing for Biased Outputs
  - Red teaming for bias
  - Counterfactual testing
  - Demographic slice testing
  - Adversarial inputs
  - A/B testing across groups
- Mitigation Strategies
  - Prompt engineering for fairness
  - Output filtering and review
  - Diverse training data curation
  - Human review queues
  - Model fine-tuning
  - Constitutional AI principles
- Diverse Testing Approaches
  - Diverse test groups (age, gender, ethnicity)
  - Scenario variety (contexts, use cases)
  - Cultural considerations (regional norms)
  - Accessibility testing (disability)
  - Language variety testing
- Continuous Monitoring for Bias
  - Ongoing evaluation pipelines
  - Metric tracking dashboards
  - Drift detection (distribution shift)
  - Alert systems (threshold violations)
  - Periodic audits
