# Agent Fundamentals

## Overview

AI agents represent a fundamental shift in how we build AI applications — from systems that respond to single queries to autonomous programs that can plan, reason, use tools, and take actions to achieve complex goals. Understanding agent fundamentals is essential before diving into specific frameworks and implementations.

This lesson establishes the conceptual foundation for everything that follows in Unit 11.

## Lessons in This Section

| # | Lesson | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 01 | [What Are AI Agents?](./01-what-are-ai-agents.md) | Defining agents, the perception-action loop, decision-making, and environmental interaction |
| 02 | [Agent vs. Assistant vs. Chatbot](./02-agent-vs-assistant-vs-chatbot.md) | Understanding the capability spectrum from simple chatbots to fully autonomous agents |
| 03 | [Autonomous vs. Semi-Autonomous Agents](./03-autonomous-vs-semi-autonomous.md) | Full autonomy characteristics, human oversight levels, hybrid approaches, and trust trade-offs |
| 04 | [Capabilities and Limitations](./04-capabilities-and-limitations.md) | What agents can and can't do today, failure modes, and setting appropriate expectations |
| 05 | [Current State of Agent Technology](./05-current-state-of-technology.md) | Industry adoption, framework landscape, research frontiers, and future trajectory |

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Unit 10: Function Calling & Tool Use
- Understanding of LLM APIs and prompt engineering (Units 3–6)
- Familiarity with RAG patterns (Unit 9)
- Python async/await proficiency

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- ✅ Define what AI agents are and how they differ from chatbots and assistants
- ✅ Explain the perception-action loop and agent decision-making process
- ✅ Distinguish between autonomous and semi-autonomous agent designs
- ✅ Identify current agent capabilities, limitations, and failure modes
- ✅ Evaluate the current state of agent technology and framework landscape
