# Execution Loop Patterns

- Simple loop (reason → act → observe)
  - Basic agent loop
  - Step-by-step execution
  - Linear progression
  - Simple implementation
- Iterative refinement loops
  - Result improvement
  - Multiple passes
  - Quality thresholds
  - Convergence detection
- Parallel execution
  - Concurrent tool calls
  - Independent subtasks
  - Result aggregation
  - Synchronization points
- Conditional branching
  - Decision points
  - Branch selection criteria
  - Path management
  - Merge strategies
- Loop termination conditions
  - Goal achievement detection
  - Quality thresholds
  - User satisfaction signals
  - Timeout conditions
- Maximum iteration limits
  - Safety limits
  - Cost protection
  - Stuck detection
  - Escalation triggers
