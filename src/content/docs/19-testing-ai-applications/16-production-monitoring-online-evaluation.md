# Production Monitoring & Online Evaluation

- Development vs Production Evaluation
  - Development: Benchmarking with datasets
  - Production: Continuous monitoring
  - Different goals and constraints
  - Complementary approaches
- Online Evaluation Requirements
  - Async execution (never block responses)
  - Minimal resource overhead
  - No local LLM judge calls in request path
  - Trend tracking over time
- Metric Collections
  - Pre-defined metric sets on cloud platform
  - metric_collection parameter in @observe
  - Centralized metric management
  - Team-wide consistency
- Async Production Evals
  - Trace export to evaluation platform
  - Background metric calculation
  - Result storage and analysis
  - No production latency impact
- Quality Trend Monitoring
  - Score tracking over time
  - Degradation detection
  - Alert thresholds
  - Seasonal pattern analysis
- Annotation Queues (LangSmith)
  - Human review workflows
  - Sample selection strategies
  - Feedback loop integration
  - Continuous improvement
- Production Alerting
  - Quality drop alerts
  - Error rate monitoring
  - Latency anomalies
  - Cost threshold alerts
- A/B Testing in Production
  - Model version comparison
  - Prompt variant testing
  - Statistical significance
  - Rollout decisions
