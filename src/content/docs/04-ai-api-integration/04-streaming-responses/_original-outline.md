# Streaming Responses

- Why streaming matters for UX
  - Perceived responsiveness
  - Immediate feedback
  - User engagement during generation
  - Progress indication
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol
  - Event stream format
  - data: prefix lines
  - Event types
  - Connection keep-alive
  - Automatic reconnection
- ReadableStream API
  - getReader() method
  - Reading chunks
  - TextDecoder for text
  - Async iteration patterns
- Parsing streamed chunks
  - data: [DONE] termination
  - JSON parsing each line
  - Buffer for incomplete lines
  - Handling split UTF-8 characters
- Delta content handling
  - content delta vs full content
  - Accumulating deltas
  - Display as received
  - Final message assembly
- Stream termination and cleanup
  - Detecting stream end
  - Closing connections
  - Releasing resources
  - Finalizing UI state
- Handling stream interruptions
  - Network error recovery
  - User cancellation
  - AbortController usage
  - Partial response handling
- Semantic streaming events (2024-2025)
  - ResponseCreatedEvent, ResponseCompletedEvent
  - ResponseOutputTextDelta for content
  - ResponseFunctionCallArgumentsDelta for tools
  - ResponseOutputItemAdded, ResponseOutputItemDone
  - Error events in streams
  - `stream_options` parameter
- Streaming function calls
  - response.function_call_arguments.delta
  - Accumulating argument chunks
  - Detecting function call completion
  - Multiple parallel function calls
- Advanced streaming patterns
  - Streaming structured outputs
  - Streaming with reasoning tokens
  - WebSocket for Realtime API
  - WebRTC for browser voice
  - SIP for telephony connections
