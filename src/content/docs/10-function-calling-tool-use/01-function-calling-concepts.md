# Function Calling Concepts

- What is function calling?
  - AI invoking external functions
  - Structured output for actions
  - Bridge between AI and code
  - Real-world capabilities
  - Also known as "tool calling" or "tool use"
- How LLMs decide to call functions
  - User intent recognition
  - Function matching
  - Parameter extraction
  - Call vs. respond decision
  - Confidence thresholds
- Function calling vs. prompt-based extraction
  - Reliability comparison
  - Schema enforcement
  - Error handling differences
  - When to use each
  - Structured outputs guarantee
- Supported providers and models (2025-2026)
  - OpenAI: GPT-5, GPT-4.1, o4-mini (Responses API)
  - Anthropic: Claude 4.5, Claude 4 Sonnet (tool use)
  - Google: Gemini 3 Pro/Flash, Gemini 2.5 (function calling)
  - Open-source: Llama 3.2, Mistral, Qwen with tool support
  - Provider API differences (Responses vs Chat Completions)
- Reasoning models and function calling
  - GPT-5, o4-mini reasoning items
  - Gemini 3 thinking process
  - Claude extended thinking
  - Passing reasoning items back to model
- Response validation before processing
  - Checking finish_reason / stop_reason
  - Detecting function call vs text response
  - Handling incomplete or failed calls
  - finishReason values by provider
- Use cases for function calling
  - Data retrieval
  - Action execution
  - Calculations
  - External API access
  - Multi-step workflows
  - Agentic applications
