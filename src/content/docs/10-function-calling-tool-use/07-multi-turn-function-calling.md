# Multi-Turn Function Calling

- Conversation flow with functions
  - Message sequence management
  - State tracking
  - Context accumulation
  - Turn management
- Multiple sequential function calls
  - Chain detection
  - Dependency handling
  - State between calls
  - Termination conditions
- Parallel function calls
  - Model requests multiple calls simultaneously
  - Concurrent execution in application
  - Result aggregation
  - Order independence
  - `parallel_tool_calls: false` to disable
- Compositional function calling
  - Model chains functions logically
  - get_location() → get_weather(location)
  - Automatic dependency resolution
  - Multi-step workflow completion
  - Live API native support (Gemini)
- Function call chains
  - Multi-step workflows
  - Intermediate results
  - Chain orchestration
  - Loop detection and prevention
- Thought signatures (Gemini 3)
  - Thinking models use internal reasoning
  - `thought_signature` in response parts
  - Must pass signatures back unchanged
  - Don't merge parts with different signatures
  - SDK handles automatically
- Maintaining context across calls
  - Conversation history management
  - Result accumulation
  - Stateful handlers
  - Memory patterns
